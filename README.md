# ITEX 2021 hackaton with Asolvi and Online NTNU
__The code will not be available until Monday 30th of August 2021 at around 13:00.__

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

We highly recommend that you install the requirements before the hackaton, since there will not be much time for this at the event.

### Node.js
The only requirement to run this program is Node.js with npm. If you do not already have npm, you can [download and install from here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### A code editor
Any code editor of your choice will do. VS code, Notepad++, VIM, Emacs, Webstorm, anything will do.
We tend to use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for React projects.
